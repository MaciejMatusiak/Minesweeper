# Minesweeper

Project created by Maciej Matusiak. The game was designed and created as a part of academic programming classes. The rules of the game and the mechanism that supports the user's movements are based on the OPP paradigm and implemented in game files divided according to the structure of object-oriented programs. The configured CMake file was used for the compilation and project management process. This application uses the SFML library to run the game in graphics mode based on the textures used in the original minesweeper version.
